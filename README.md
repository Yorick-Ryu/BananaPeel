# BananaPeel | 香蕉皮 🍌

**BananaPeel** is a browser extension that helps you quickly remove the background from any image. No more hassle with third-party background removal websites!

As a developer, I often use AI tools to generate images for software icons, but I always struggle with removing the background. That's why I created this extension.

## 🎯 The Pain Points

- **AI-generated images have backgrounds:** Whether you use Nano Banana, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or other AI tools, the generated images almost always come with a background.
- **Cumbersome download and upload process:** You have to download the image, open a third-party website, upload it, and wait for it to be processed.
- **Long waiting times:** Sometimes the upload process is slow and fails.
- **It gets expensive:** Free quotas run out quickly, and then you have to pay.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Truly One-Click Operation:** Right-click on an image to process it directly, eliminating the need to download and re-upload.
- **🖼️ Instant Preview:** The result is displayed in a pop-up window that can be dragged to any position.
- **🤖 Multiple Models Available:**
  Models from open source project: [rembg Models](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#models)
- **🛡️ Two Modes:**
  - Use our provided server for quick start.
  - Deploy a private server. We provide a [server](https://github.com/Yorick-Ryu/rembg-server) optimized based on [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg), which can easily deploy the backend service on your local computer.
