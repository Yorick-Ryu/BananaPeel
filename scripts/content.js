// This script is now largely redundant, as the modal is created by the background script.
// However, we still need to listen for the context menu click and forward the request to the background script.

// The background script will inject this file, but the main logic is now in background.js.
// We can keep this file for potential future use or for logic that *must* run in the page context.

// For now, we can simplify this file greatly. The background script handles all modal logic.
// The only thing that might be needed is to trigger the initial processing from a page context,
// but the current implementation starts from the context menu, which is handled by the background script.

// Let's leave a placeholder listener in case we need to communicate from the page in the future.
